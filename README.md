============

this project is for computing practice & theory at the evergreen state college.

project in neural networks. components:
* main
  * main
  * hasKey
  * todo:
     * need to make prompt and interactivity
* neuralNet
  * neuron
  * neuralNetLayer
  * neuralNet
  * todo:
     * need to test (needs real RNG)
* propagate
  * backprop
